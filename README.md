Storage library for node. 
An unique api to use all databases (SQL and NOSQL)

*I don't want to design it, I want to use it.*

## Features
 - Unique interface for all databases (if someone write the dirver)
 - Integrated acl

Ok, ok... I know that the goal is very ambitious. But wait, my idea is that for many projects the 
requirements are not so complex, we just need for a storage of
 - objects  
 - relations between objects
 - permissions on objects
 - indexes and summaries

So, starting from this point of view, we can write some simple API that can work with all databases.
I already wrote the driver for couchdb, but I'm pretty sure I can write the same API for MySQL, mongodb, 
oracle, MsSql, Cassandra, orientdb etc.
